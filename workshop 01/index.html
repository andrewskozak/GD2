<h1>Emilie Villeneuve</h1> 

<h3>Interviewed by Andrew Kozak</h3>

<p>
<strong>What music do you like to listen to while working?</strong><br>
To be honest, i like to listen to pop. I don't really need "locked in" music.
</p>

<p>
    <br>
<strong>Name three designers whose work you find inspiring.</strong> <br>
    <ul>

        <li>Bruno Munari. </li>
        <li>Elliot Earls. </li>
        <li>Yayoi Kusama. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <br>
<strong>Name something (a format, an item) you want to learn how to design but haven't had the chance to try to yet. </strong><br>
I guess I haven't done book covers, or publications, or magazines. Or a product. or stickers. Anything kind of fun. 
</p>

<p>
     <br>
<strong>If you were a font, you'd be (you can't say helvetica or comic sans-- both jokes are played). Explain why?</strong><br>
The first one that comes to mind is Calibri. It's kind of cute, fun, neutral. 
</p>

<p>
    <br>
<strong>Name one website that you rely on (try to avoid a platform like google/amazon/pinterest/etc).</strong><br>
Can I say <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva?</a> 
<a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank"> Adobe Fonts?</a> 
Can I switch to<a href="https://open.spotify.com/" target="_blank">  Spotify?</a>
</p>

<p>
    <br>
<strong>Do you have a minor at OCAD?</strong><br>
I thought I would like to get into Digital Futures, but it wasn't for me. I'm kind of an indecisive person. I'd probably do printmaking if I could.
